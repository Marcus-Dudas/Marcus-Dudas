- Hi, I’m @Marcus-Dudas
- I’m interested in making web-dev and data-analysis one part of a career, because those things are fun.
- I’m currently learning on my own and in my free time.
- I do not expect these repositories to be viewed or to be useful (for others).
- What are you doing here? Skidaddle!
